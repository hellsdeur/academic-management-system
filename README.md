# academic-management-system
Java project for a simple academic management system

## 1. Introduction
This project was created during a undergraduate course of Object Oriented Programming, aiming to cover most of the basics concepts of OOP.

## 2. Objective
Develop a academic management system that mimics the basic functionalities that most universities and colleges use to integrate their activities. Some of the funcionalities include:  

    a. Different user hierarquies (professor, students, administration)  
    b. Freshman students register  
    c. Classes management  
    d. Enrollment  
    e. Activities management  
    f. Grading  
  
## 3. Methodology
The project must be developed and written in Java programming language and must use OOP concepts such as objects, classes, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, etc. A Test-Driven Development approach was used during the code implementation, which details most of the procedure required for the project.
